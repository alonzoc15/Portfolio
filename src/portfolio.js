    "Alonzo Camille, a full stack software developer that loves finding innovative ways to use technology to make a simple lifestyle for anyone using it. I graduated from Florida A&M University with a Bachelors of Science in Business Administration. After Spending just over a year at Penske Truck Rental I realized that I liked the feeling of being able to wear various hats and connect with people from different backgrounds but I did not find myself emotionally fulfilled from the work I was doing. It was during this time that I had started to challenge myself and learn to code and I had learned to love the feeling of being able build something on my computer. Shortly after I had found the Digital Crafts Software Engineering Immersive and it wasn't long before I was enrolled. The Digital Crafts immersive has been my most satisfying challenge to date and has helped me fulfill a strong desire to create products with value. Since receiving my certificate in software engineering from DigitalCrafts in Atlanta, GA I relocated to Tampa, Fl where I have been employed as a Full Stack Software Developer with companies such as Peraton and FedEx Services.",
